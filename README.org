* hyper-org-mode
** About
Hyper org-mode provides real-time collaboration of org mode files via a server (see https://github.com/alexkehayias/hyper-org-mode). This package provides automatic local file syncing of org files in the background.
** Usage
In your emacs init file, add the following snippets:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'hyper-org-mode)
(setq hyper-org-dir "/.hyper-org")
(setq hyper-org-url "http://127.0.0.1:1986")
(setq hyper-org-files (list "todo.org"))
(setq hyper-org-sync-freq-sec 5)
#+END_SRC
This will synchronize files every 5 seconds with the server. Whenever you save a file locally it will push a copy to the server.
** Conflict Resolution
Coming soon!
